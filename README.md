## Usage

Create test environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git
git clone https://github.com/l50/caldera-security-tests
cd caldera-security-tests
# Environment for the first XSS
./bin/"cst-$(uname)" TestEnv --uno
# Environment for the second XSS
./bin/"cst-$(uname)" TestEnv --dos
```

Create test environment, run the first XSS,
and tear the test environment down:

```bash
./bin/cst-darwin TestEnv -1
./bin/"cst-$(uname)" StoredXSSUno
./bin/"cst-$(uname)" TestEnv -d
```

Create test environment, run the second XSS,
and tear the test environment down:

```bash
./bin/cst-darwin TestEnv -2
./bin/"cst-$(uname)" StoredXSSDos
./bin/"cst-$(uname)" TestEnv -d
```

### Developer Environment Setup

0. [Fork this project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

1. Clone your forked repo and caldera:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/l50/caldera-security-tests.git
   git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git
   ```

2. (Optional) If you installed gvm, create golang pkgset specifically for this project:

   ```bash
   VERSION='1.18'
   PROJECT=caldera-security-tests

   gvm install "go${VERSION}"
   gvm use "go${VERSION}"
   gvm pkgset create "${PROJECT}"
   gvm pkgset use "${PROJECT}"
   ```

3. Generate the `magefile` binary:

   ```bash
   mage -d .mage/ -compile ../magefile
   ```

4. Install pre-commit hooks and dependencies:

   ```bash
   ./magefile installPreCommitHooks
   ```

5. Update and run pre-commit hooks locally:

   ```bash
   ./magefile runPreCommit
   ```

6. Compile binary:

   ```bash
   ./magefile compile $uname
   ```
