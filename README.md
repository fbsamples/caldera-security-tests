## Usage

Create test environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git
git clone https://github.com/fbsamples/caldera-security-tests
cd caldera-security-tests
# Download the release binary and drop it in ./bin/
# from the root of the repo.
```

Create first test environment, run the first XSS,
and tear the test environment down:

```bash
./bin/cst-darwin TestEnv -1
export OS="$(uname | python3 -c "print(open(0).read().lower().strip())")"
./bin/"cst-${OS}" StoredXSSUno
./bin/"cst-${OS}" TestEnv -d
```

Create second test environment, run the second XSS,
and tear the test environment down:

```bash
./bin/cst-darwin TestEnv -2
./bin/"cst-$(uname)" StoredXSSDos
./bin/"cst-$(uname)" TestEnv -d
```

Parameters for the tests can be modified
in the generated `config/config.yaml` file.
This file is created as soon as the `TestEnv`
command in the above example is run.

### Developer Environment Setup

0. [Fork this project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

1. Clone your forked repo and caldera:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fbsamples/caldera-security-tests.git
   git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git
   ```

2. (Optional) If you installed gvm, create golang pkgset specifically for this project:

   ```bash
   VERSION='1.18'
   PROJECT=caldera-security-tests

   gvm install "go${VERSION}"
   gvm use "go${VERSION}"
   gvm pkgset create "${PROJECT}"
   gvm pkgset use "${PROJECT}"
   ```

3. Generate the `magefile` binary:

   ```bash
   mage -d .mage/ installDeps
   mage -d -compile ../magefile
   ```

4. Install pre-commit hooks and dependencies:

   ```bash
   mage -d .mage/ installDeps
   mage -d .mage/ installPreCommitHooks
   ```

5. Update and run pre-commit hooks locally:

   ```bash
   ./magefile runPreCommit
   ```

6. Compile binary:

   ```bash
   export OS="$(uname | python3 -c "print(open(0).read().lower().strip())")"
   ./magefile compile ${OS}
   ```
